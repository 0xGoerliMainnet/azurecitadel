## Overview

Azure VMware Solution is a Microsoft service runningon Azure infrastructure.Microsoft manages and maintains the private cloud infrastructure and software, allowing you to focus on developing and running workloads in your private clouds to deliver business value.

The minimum initial deployment is three hosts, but more hosts can be added one at a time, up to a maximum of 16 hosts per cluster. All provisioned private clouds have VMware vCenter Server, VMware vSAN, VMware vSphere, and VMware NSX-T Data Center.

## Licensing benefits

Azure Hybrid Benefit allows you to bring your existing licenses to Azure and reduce costs. Azure Reservations discounts for reserved instances (and no cancellation fees). Azure VMware Solution offers 1-year and 3-year reserved instances for dedicated hosts, saving around 30-50% of the total cost of a node12.

AVS also features the Azure Attestation service, and is therefore one of the AMMP targets and is also valid for free Extended Support Updates.
