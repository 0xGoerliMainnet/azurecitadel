## Resource Group

First, we'll create a resource group in the portal.

1. Open <https://portal.azure.com>
1. Open [Resource Groups](https://portal.azure.com/#view/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceGroups)

    In Navigate, the top left hamburger flyout, or by searching on "resource groups" in the blue search bar.

1. *+ Create*
1. Set Resource Group to *myResourceGroup*
1. Set Region to *West Europe*

    Azure has 60+ regions grouped in [geographies](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/geographies/#overview).

## Next

OK, you can now see the subscription and have full access with both Global Admin (AAD) and Owner (Azure RBAC).

In the next page we'll create a resource group and resource and get to know about providers and resource IDs.
