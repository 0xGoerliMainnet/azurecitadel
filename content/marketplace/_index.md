## Introduction

Microsoft's commercial marketplace is a catalog of solutions and services from our partner network. Microsoft partners can use Partner Center to create, publish and manage their solutions and services offerings in the commercial marketplace. Solutions are listed in Microsoft's online stores, alongside Microsoft's own solutions, connecting you with businesses, organizations, and government agencies around the world.

This lab will introduce you to some of the essential concepts and terminology of the commercial marketplace with a particular focus on ISVs (Independent Software Vendors) building solutions on Azure. We will focus on cloud solutions rather than services; in other words, how the commercial marketplace caters for cloud solutions built on Microsoft Azure and how to go about publishing them.
