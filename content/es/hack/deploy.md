## Pre-reqs

You will need 2-3 subscriptions to deploy Enterprise Scale properly using the official Microsoft repo.

We will use the quickstart to deploy the vanilla deployment before we move into the Azure Baristas scenario.

## Quickstart

Click on <https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale#quickstart> and then follow Cloud Solution Architect, Matt White, in the video below.
