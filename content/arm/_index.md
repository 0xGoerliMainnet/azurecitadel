## Introduction

This is a placeholder page.

We know that the ARM template labs are some of the most popular on the old Citadel site, and we want to take this opportunity to refresh the content as we move it over. There is so much more functionality now available in the ARM area so it is a well overdue update.

We will release new content in batches as it is created. Bear with us!

## Previous labs
