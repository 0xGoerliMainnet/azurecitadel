## Introduction

This is a short and simple lab to introduce you to the Terraform workflow and HCL file format.  Everything will be run within the bash version of the Azure Cloud Shell which already has Terraform installed and maintained for you, so all you need for this lab is an active Azure subscription.


## Summary

We have reached the end of the lab and you now have some exposure to the basics of the Terraform workflow and state.

In the next lab we will introduce variables and start to use multiple .tf files.
