## Introduction

This is a placeholder page for the Terraform 0.14 labs.

We know that the Terraform labs are some of the most popular on the old Citadel site, and we want to take this opportunity to refresh the content as we move it over. There is so much more functionality now available in the newer versions of Terraform so it is a well overdue update. Plus we have developed preferred ways to bootstrap environments, leverage split state and look at options for organising and manageing Terraform environments during their lifecycle.

We will release new content in batches as it is created. Bear with us!
