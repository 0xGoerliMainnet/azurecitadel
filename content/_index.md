# Azure Citadel

## Welcome to the Azure Citadel

Azure Citadel is a community driven site devoted to getting hands on & learning Azure. Explore technical labs & videos across a range of Azure topics.

### New Hugo site

We have moved over to a Hugo generated site integrated with an Azure Static Web App via a GitHub Actions pipeline. The new site has a custom theme which is cleaner and easier to navigate.

This change has given us an opportunity to clean up older content as the Azure documentation has grown and the Microsoft Learn site covers so much ground. Therefore we will be focusing purely on materials that are pitched towards the needs of the Azure partner community, but are freely available for all to use.

### Where's the \<insert name here> lab?

The old site has been moved to <https://archive.azurecitadel.com>. Note that some of the material on the archive is now out of date. If you have favourite materials that you think should be moved on to here then let us know in the [lab suggestions](https://github.com/azurecitadel/azurecitadel/discussions/7).
