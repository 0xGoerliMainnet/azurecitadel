### Create a Pull Request

All changes that get merged into the **main** branch of Azure Citadel get Continuously Deployed to [live](/). To ensure quality all changes must be reviewed prior to being deployed.

The mechanism for reviewing changes is the **Pull Request**

You can create a Pull Request by following the prompt after proposing your changes in the previous step.

The **Title** and **Description** of the Pull Request will be auto-populated from the Git commit that you created on your branch.

After you're happy that you have included enough information, especially when proposing larger changes, you just have to **Create pull request**

Pull Requests provide a space for discussions to take place and keep a log of the the reasons why certain changes were made.
