## Introduction

The Hugo [shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) are very useful for embedding tweets, Instagram posts, Vimeo videos, etc.

We have also added additional custom shortcodes for buttons, details, light/dark images, tables and raw HTML. See the shortcode templates in `/themes/citadel/layouts/shortcodes`.
